    <h1>Just Getting Started</h1>
    <p>What we have here is the very beginning of a project for a CS 313 course.
    For now, there's not a whole lot here, so I put up a little about myself.</p>
    <p>I've been "coding" since I was in the third grade - which was quite a long
    while ago, and was also a number of years before I even had a computer to
    program <em>on</em>. So, my first number of programs took the form of lines
    of Basic handwritten in spiral notebooks. They were generally Choose Your
    Own Adventure &TRADE; type programs that presented a little narrative and
    gave the user some options that would progress the story. Of course, the
    programs weren't too terribly functional, what with having to be content as
    strictly non-digital content, they weren't too exciting for anyone but
    myself.</p>
    <p>Flash forward a whole bunch of years - I still code, and I still code
    <em>just for fun</em>, but at least some of my code is actually executable
    these days (if not actually published, or particularly useful). I've never
    programmed professionally. Though, I was just lucky enough to figure out a
    few ways to work a little coding here and there into some of my past jobs, but
    never really as the primary function. I've programmed in Basic/QBasic/Visual
    Basic, C/C++, Visual C++, C#, Java, ASP, php, JavaScript, and even a little
    assembly language.</p>
    <p>When I'm coding without any particular purpose, I lean towards making games,
    or little game-like programs. My "best" games have come through XNA, which
    gave me the tools to create a little better stuff than I had done before, as
    well as a means to see my code run on the Xbox 360, which feels cool - but
    still, as with most of my stuff, is really only very satisfying for <em>me</em>.</p>
    <p>I'm sure there's more I could list here, but most of it's not too interesting,
    and if you read this far, I'd hate to put you through any more at this point.
    Perhaps as the semester goes by, more will show up here, or maybe it'll get
    replaced with something more appealing.</p>
    <p>Anyway, thanks for stopping by.</p>
